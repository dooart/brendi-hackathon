# Study Assistant

A powerful AI-powered study assistant that helps you learn, take notes, and review content effectively. The application combines modern AI capabilities with proven learning techniques like spaced repetition and the Zettelkasten method.

## Features

- ü§ñ **AI-Powered Chat**: Interact with an AI assistant that can help you understand concepts and automatically create notes from your conversations
- üìù **Smart Note-Taking**: Automatic note creation when important concepts are detected in conversations
- üß† **Spaced Repetition System (SRS)**: Review your notes at optimal intervals for better retention
- üîÑ **Zettelkasten Method**: Visualize connections between your notes in an interactive knowledge graph
- üìö **Document Management**: Upload and process study materials (PDFs supported)
- üéØ **Review System**: Test your knowledge with AI-generated questions based on your notes

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express
- **Database**: SQLite (better-sqlite3)
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI API and local models (Ollama)
- **Document Processing**: PDF.js and pdf-parse

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- OpenAI API key (for OpenAI features)
- Ollama (optional, for local model support)
