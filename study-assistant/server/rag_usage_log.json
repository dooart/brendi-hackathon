Modern iterative methods for solving linear systems are techniques that generate a sequence of approximations to the solution of a system \\(Ax = b\\), especially useful for large, sparse matrices where direct methods like Gaussian elimination become computationally expensive.\n\n### Key points about modern iterative methods:\n\n1. **Basic Idea**:  \n   Instead of solving the system directly, these methods start with an initial guess \\(x^{(0)}\\) and iteratively improve it. Each iteration produces a better approximation \\(x^{(k+1)}\\) based on the previous one \\(x^{(k)}\\).\n\n2. **Advantages over Direct Methods**:  \n   - They can exploit a good initial guess to speed up convergence.  \n   - If only a crude approximation is required, iterative methods can be stopped early and still provide useful results.  \n   - Well-suited for very large or sparse systems where direct methods are expensive or infeasible.\n\n3. **Classical Iterative Methods**:  \n   Examples include Jacobi's method, where each equation is used to update the corresponding unknown in the solution vector iteratively. Each iteration uses the previous approximation to generate the next.\n\n4. **Modern Krylov Subspace Methods**:  \n   These include methods like BiCG (Biconjugate Gradient), QMR (Quasi-Minimal Residual), BiCGSTAB (BiConjugate Gradient Stabilized), CGS (Conjugate Gradient Squared), and GMRES (Generalized Minimal Residual). They are more sophisticated and often converge faster than classical methods.  \n   - They work by projecting the problem onto a sequence of Krylov subspaces to find approximate solutions.\n\n5. **Preconditioning**:  \n   To improve convergence, preconditioning is often used. A preconditioner transforms the system into an equivalent one that is easier for iterative methods to solve. For example, incomplete LU (ILU) decomposition can be used as a preconditioner. This can significantly reduce the number of iterations needed.  \n   In MATLAB, routines like `luinc` compute incomplete LU factors for preconditioning, which can be combined with iterative solvers such as BiCG.\n\n### Summary from the source (Fundamentals of Matrix Computations by David S.

This truly elegant formula is too expensive to be a practical computational tool, except when   n =   2 or 3, because it requires the computation of determinants. At the end of Section 1.1 we mentioned Strassen's method [68] and other methods that multiply two   n x n   matrices together in fewer than O(n 3 ) flops. For example, Strassen's method takes   O(n s )   flops, where   s =   Iog 2   7   2.81. These methods can be modified so that they compute   A~ l .   Therefore there exist methods that solve  Ax = b   in fewer than O(n 3 ) flops. Some of these methods could become important for large, dense (i.e. not sparse) matrix computations at some future date. All of the methods that we have discussed so far are   direct methods;   if they were executed in exact arithmetic, they would produce the exact solution to   Ax = b   after a finite, prespecified sequence of operations. A completely different type of method is the   iterative method,   which produces a sequence of successively better approxima- tions to the solution.

This problem can be solved without difficulty, even for fairly large values of n, by Gaussian elimination on today's computers. However, once   n  becomes very large (e.g. several thousand) and the matrix   A   becomes very sparse (e.g. 99.9% of its entries are zeros), iterative methods become more efficient. This chapter begins with a section that shows how such large, sparse problems can arise.   Then the classical iterative methods are introduced and analyzed. From there we move on to a discussion of descent methods, including the powerful conjugate gradient method for solving positive definite systems. The important idea of preconditioning is introduced along the way. The conjugate gradient method is just one of a large family of Krylov subspace methods. The chapter concludes with a brief discussion of Krylov subspace methods for indefinite and nonsymmetric problems. We restrict our attention to real systems throughout the chapter. However, virtually everything said here can be extended to the complex case.  7.1   A MODEL PROBLEM  Large sparse matrices arise routinely in the numerical solution of partial differential equations (PDE).

A discussion of these important techniques is beyond the scope of this book. The convergence theory of the classical iterative methods is laid out in [36], [76], and [84], for example. For the model Poisson problem the theory is complete, and most of the theory carries over to other positive definite systems that admit a red- black ordering: The convergence rates of all of the classical iterative methods are determined by the spectral radius of the Jacobi iteration matrix. So far we have restricted our attention to simple iterative methods with no memory. These methods construct   x^ k+1 ^   from   x^;   they make no use of x^\" 1 )   or earlier iterates.   An advantage of these methods is that they economize on memory: Old iterates need not be saved.   One might wonder, nevertheless, whether there might possibly be some gain from saving a few previous iterates and somehow making use of the information that they contain. They would give an idea of the general trend of the iterations and might be used to extrapolate to a much better estimate of the solution. This train of ideas was pursued successfully by Golub and Varga, who invented the Chebyshev semi-iterative method, also known as Chebyshev acceleration. A related technique is conjugate gradient acceleration.   Both of these acceleration techniques generate x( k+1 ) "
